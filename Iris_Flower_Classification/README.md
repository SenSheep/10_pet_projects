**Project 1: Iris Flower Classification**

### Project Overview:
The Iris Flower Classification project is designed to predict the species of an iris flower based on its measurements. It utilizes a classic machine learning problem to demonstrate fundamental principles of data processing, model building, and web application deployment.

### Key Components:

1. **Data**:
   - Uses the Iris dataset, which contains information on three species of iris flowers (setosa, versicolor, virginica) with measurements including sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.

2. **Model**:
   - Trains a machine learning model to classify the species of the iris based on provided measurements. Three models were trained using different algorithms: K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Decision Tree, and Random Forest. The Random Forest model was selected for deployment due to its accuracy.

3. **Web Application**:
   - **Input Form**: Users enter the measurements of the iris flower.
   - **Prediction**: After submitting the form, the data is sent to the model, which predicts the iris species.
   - **Results**: The predicted species is displayed on the results page, with an option to make another prediction.

4. **Technologies**:
   - **Python**: For building and training the machine learning model.
   - **Flask**: A lightweight framework for creating web applications.
   - **HTML/CSS**: For designing user interfaces.
   - **Scikit-learn**: A library for machine learning and data handling.

### How It Works:
1. The user opens the web application.
2. Inputs measurements (sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width).
3. Clicks the button to get a prediction.
4. The classification model returns the predicted iris species, which is displayed on the results page.
5. The user can input new data for another prediction.

### Project Goals:
- Practice in machine learning and web development.
- Demonstrate skills in working with models, data, and web interfaces.
- Develop a simple and user-friendly application for end users.
